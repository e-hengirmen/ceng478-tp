# ceng478-tp
Repository for ceng478 Introduction to Parallel Computing term project
The term project is about parallelizing matrix multiplication
## [Report.pdf](https://github.com/e-hengirmen/ceng478-tp/blob/main/Report.pdf)
Contains my Term Project report 
## [solution.c](https://github.com/e-hengirmen/ceng478-tp/blob/main/src/solution.c)
Contains my code submission for the problem
## [script.sh](https://github.com/e-hengirmen/ceng478-tp/blob/main/src/script.sh)
Will create 2 NxN matrices and save it inside `input` file. Print timers of parallel and sequential algorithms and save their ouputs inside `output` and `output2` files.

If you want to try matrices of different sizes change the defined N value inside `solution.c` files.
