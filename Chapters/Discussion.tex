I have used mpi libraries inc to check efficiency in my local system with maximum N being 1250 with p being 4\\
\\
While the program is faster then the sequential by 2 times(with 4 processes) it has not reached the expected efficiency of 4 times efficiency.\\
\\
my last 10 calculations with matrices of size 1250 and process count 4 are:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{ |c|c|c|c| } 
		\hline
		calculation & Parallel time & Sequential time \\ \hline
		1 & 5.216810 & 10.601020 \\ 
		2 & 5.297901 & 11.049214 \\ 
		3 & 5.411365 & 10.672823 \\ 
		4 & 5.523047 & 11.764370 \\ 
		5 & 5.510580 & 11.284287 \\ 
		6 & 5.645570 & 11.071797 \\ 
		7 & 5.364452 & 10.596364 \\ 
		8 & 5.581612 & 11.129922 \\ 
		9 & 5.698069 & 11.561105 \\ 
		10 & 5.745044 & 11.697457 \\ 
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
But according to my calculations I was thinking that there was a problem with my system. $\frac{parallel}{sequential}$ (assuming t$_s$ and t$_m$ are little numbers (1)) for N=1250 and p=4. I was thinking of the theoritical model of using scatter/gather in my calculations which led me to believe that I should have been getting 4 times faster for the parallel algorithm(since both of their gamma time complexities were same).
\[
\frac{\frac{2N^3-N^2}{p}+3log_2(p)+2\sqrt{p}-1+\frac{N^2}{p}(3p+2\sqrt{p}-4)}{2N^3-N^2}=
\]
\[\frac{81738282}{325390625}=0.251200482496998\]
Even when I changed my calculations to the model I have implemented there wasn't a big difference in the calculations for N 1250 and p being 4 it should have been 4 times more efficient yet it remained being only 2 times efficient. 
\[
\frac{\frac{2N^3-N^2}{P}+(3p+2\sqrt{p}-2)(t_s+\frac{N^2}{p}t_m)}{2N^3-N^2}=
\]
\[\frac{981640639}{1951562500}=0.25140056380952\]
